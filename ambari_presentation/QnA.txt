Questions : 
1. My Hadoop cluster is already installed. Can I use ambari to manage it. — done that for some clients, kind of complex. takeover_config_merge.py

2. I want to install my own hadoop version and manage it through amber from scratch.  — custom stack is possible


3. I want to add my own custom services to amber stack   — yes, recommended to remove it when upgrading through Ambari and add it back again after upgrading.


4. Upgrading stack HDP versus upgrading Ambari.    — upgrade amber first from cli and then upgrade HDP 


5. Can I upgrade individual services using Ambari.    — No, but some work is going on for future support



support other stacks like PHD : pivotal HD — emc2
example HDF is  
HCS — metron
